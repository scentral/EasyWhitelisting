# EasyWhitelisting

I made this while creating a framework and thought why not save it on my github and allow people to use it. 
This takes a Request function from the Badger_Discord_API script and just uses it to pull the users roles and check if it has a matching role in the config. I probably won't ever make any changes to this as it was just something I said why not post yk. Any issues contact me in my [discord](https://discord.gg/DUVx2wHTV8)
